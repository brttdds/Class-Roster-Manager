# Cplusplus-project

You are hired as a contractor to help a university migrate an existing student system to a new platform using C++. The program will read a list of five students and use function calls to manipulate data. While parsing the list of data, the program should create student objects. The entire student list will be stored in one array of students called classRosterArray. Specific data-related output will be directed to the console.
